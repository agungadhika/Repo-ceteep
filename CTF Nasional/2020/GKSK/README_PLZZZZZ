Hi, AnehMan's here, the coordinator of the CTF event...
Thank you for your participation.

Please fill this quick survey if you haven't fill it. This survey is for us, for a better future :)
https://forms.gle/GwARpN9shMDQpoat8

So, I give you the challenges (with/without source code)
Some of the challenges have the solver, some of them are semi-manual solver, and some of them haven't any solver.

We use 'CTFd' as a platform, make sure you check it out, this is a nice platform
https://github.com/CTFd/CTFd

and the zipped file named "GKSK#5-CTF.2020-03-04.zip" is our backup data. After you installed CTFd, you can import it to see our platform.
Oh, I gave you admin access

Username: admin
Password: password

*NOTE: I just made that account. That account is NOT registered before the event end.


Ah, too much talk. Not good...
So, again. Thank you for your participation. I hope you join us again at GKSK#6 CTF.


See ya ^^







*PS: Pssst, we are from 'Kelompok Studi Linux' or 'KSL'. We have a similar event called 'SlashrootCTF'. Make sure you check that out ;)
